                          <h5>BRIEF SYNOPSIS</h5>
                          <p>Princess Irulan Corrino secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still live, while her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, is dispirited after promoting the fall of House Atreides. En route to Sietch Tabr on Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen ambush. Reaching the Sietch, some Fremen suspect Jessica and Paul are spies, though others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the "Outer World" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.

                              Stilgar informs Jessica that their Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must be her replacement and drink the "Water of Life", fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes the poison, and thus survives and inherits the memories of every female ancestor in the lineage. The Water also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree that Northern Arrakis, especially the weak-minded, must be convinced first of the prophecy. Chani and her friend Shishakli believe the prophecy is false and designed to control the Fremen; but when Paul makes a speech about not seeking power and wanting only to fight alongside them, Chani develops respect for him.
                              
                              Paul embraces Fremen ways and learns their language, taking part in rites such as riding the largest sandworm ever seen, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, and assisting in raids on Harkonnen spice harvesters. Paul forms a romantic relationship with Chani and takes on the Fremen name "Usul" and the Fremen title of "Muad'Dib". Due to the spice raids, Baron Harkonnen replaces his nephew Rabban as Arrakis' ruler with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to seduce Feyd, subject him to the Gom Jabbar test, and secure his genes, in case Paul's bloodline is unsalvageable.
                              
                              Jessica travels South to unite with more fundamentalist Fremen. Paul fears his visions of a holy war will manifest if he also goes South as a messiah. He stays in the North and reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads Paul to House Atreides' hidden atomic stockpile. Feyd attacks Sietch Tabr and burns Shishakli to death, which forces survivors, including Paul, to journey South. Upon arriving, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a deep coma. Chani awakens him by mixing her tears with the Water across his lips, slapping him when he wakes: he attains both prescience and knowledge of the past, seeing a vision of an adult Alia on a water-filled beach and realizing the Baron is his maternal grandfather.
                              
                              The Southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar for leadership, but he refuses and instead proves himself by reciting the thoughts of two Fremen spectators. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib, and sends a letter challenging Shaddam, who then arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. Paul's Fremen surround Shaddam and attack, using atomics and sandworms. The Sardaukar are overpowered, and Paul kills the Baron and takes Shaddam and his entourage captive. Gurney catches up with Rabban and kills him.
                              
                              As Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy Arrakis' spice fields with the Atreides' atomics if they intervene. Paul challenges Shaddam to a duel, who chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion. Feyd-Rautha nearly kills Paul, before Paul fatally stabs him. Imploring Paul to spare her father's life, Irulan offers herself as Paul's bride. Though Paul accepts this, he tells Chani he will always love her. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring, though above Arrakis, the Great Houses refuse to accept Paul's ascendancy. He orders his Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet, saying "Lead them to Paradise." Jessica and Alia reflect that this is the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war, while a heartbroken Chani refuses to bow to Paul, and departs on a sandworm.</p>
